    "The Neural Information Processing Scaled for Bioacoustics (NIPS4B) bird song competition asks participants to identify which of 87 sound classes of birds and their ecosystem are present in 1000 continuous wild recordings from different places in Provence, France. The data is provided by the BIOTOPE society, which maintains the largest collection of wild recordings of birds in Europe. This challenge is a more complex task than the previous ICML4B challenge, in which 77 teams participated (see proceedings at sabiod.org).\n",
    "The training set contains 687 files. Each species is represented by nearly 10 training files (within various context / other species). The files were recorded at a frequency sample of 44.1 kHz on an SM2 system.\n",
    "Submissions are judged on area under the ROC curve. "
